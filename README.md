# the_country_number
A small library for flutter written in pure dart (doesn't use libphonenumber) which parses a phone number or iso2 code of a country to give you some vitals about the country *(thanks for everyone who contributed to the data [here](https://gist.github.com/Goles/3196253))*
#### go *[here](https://github.com/ondbyte/the_country_number_widgets)* for a flutter input widget which is based on this
*use version 0.9.0 to skip nullsafety*

this library is a singleton so you can use the library right-away
```dart
final theNumber = TheCountryNumber().parse();
```
if you have the complete international number as string
```dart
//a united arab emirates number
final _numberString = "+971565656565";
final theNumber = TheCountryNumber().parse(internationalNumber:_numberString);
print(theNumber.dialCode);//prints +971
print(theNumber.number);//prints 565656565
```
further the parsed number contains a `TheCountry` object which provides some useful vitals
```dart
final country = theNumber.country;
print(country.englishName);//prints United Arab Emirates
print(country.localName);//prints دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة (hope spelling is correct)
print(country.currency);//prints AED
//etc
```
you can parse `TheNumber` with other properties as well, but the number component will be missing
```dart
final theNumber = TheCountryNumber().parseNumber(iso2Code: "IN");
print(theNumber.dialCode);//prints the international dial-code for this country "+91"
print(theNumber.number); //prints empty
//access country details
final country = theNumber.country;
print(country.englishName);//prints India
print(country.localName);//prints भारत (hope spelling is correct)
print(country.currency);//prints INR
```
further you can parse realtime in flutter on input data changed
```dart
final numberWithCountryDetails = TheCountryNumber().parse(iso2Code:"AE");
//parse realtime when data is available
onChanged(s){
  ///consider s = "565656565";
  if(s.isEmpty()){
    return;
  }
  final newNumber = numberWithCountryDetails.addNumber(s);
  //check if the length is valid for the given country
  if(newNumber.isValidLength){
    //do something
    print(newNumber.dialCode);//prints +971
    print(newNumber.internationalNumber);//prints +971565656565
  }
}
```
A  `NotANumber` object will be returned if failed to parse, you can check if the return Object is not a number
```dart
final theSupposedNumber = TheCountryNumber().parse(iso2Code:"xxxxxx");
if(theSupposedNumber.isNotANumber){
  //cancel operation
  return;
}
```
*keep in mind that some countries support phone numbers of multiple lengths, which is supported too*
